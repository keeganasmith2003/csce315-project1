            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <h4>Inroduction</h4>
            <p>
                Howdy, I am a junior computer science major at Texas A&M and I work as a student technician for Texas A&M's High Performance Research Computing center. 
            </p>
            <h4>Hobbies</h4>
            <p>
                I currently enjoy powerlifting (recreationally) and I also play tennis every once in a while.
                <br> 
                <br>
                My goal with powerlifting is to someday reach a total of 650 kg
                (bench press + squat + deadlift) at 83 kg weight. This would possibly earn me a place in the competitive powerlifting scene, and of course the exercise is
                good for my health.
                <br>
                <br>
                I have been playing tennis since high school, and I made regionals during my senior year. I still play tennis occasionally, but many of my college friends 
                don't play tennis which is kind of a bummer.
