            <h2>My Software Projects</h2>
            <h4>College Football Schedules</h4>
            <p>In this project I created most of the backend funcionality for the College Football Schedules app which is available on iOS - <a href = "https://apps.apple.com/us/app/college-football-schedules-23/id1028810756">College Football Schedules '23</a></p>
            <br>
            <p>I helped configure the cloudkit database and automated the process of pulling data from the <a href = "https://api.collegefootballdata.com/api/docs/?url=/api-docs.json">cfbd api</a>, transforming the data, and inserting it into the database. This was done using javascript and the cloudkit JS library.
                 I also created the UI and functionality for the favorites page which allows users to store and view their favorite teams.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                The app currently has a little over 1,000 subscribers (many more downloads). We expect this number to grow as the college football season progresses.
